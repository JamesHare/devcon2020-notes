# Learning and Building a Homelab

Build side projects to keep learning.

"When I hear I forget. When I see I remember. When I do I learn."

Things that started as side projects:

* gmail
* facebook
* github
* craigslist
* twitter
* khan academy

Side projects:

* give you a space to learn and a place to fail
* teach you how to perservere
* Gives you big picture thinking

When thinking about a side project:

* Start small
* Keep an "idea book"
* Perfect is the enemy of done

Open Source:

* An opportunity to learn
* Build confidence
* Take criticism of your code

How to find a project to contribute to?

* github.com/trending
* github.com/explore
* podcasts
* conference talks on YouTube
* Local conferences and meetups

You can even start by just writing documentation for an existing project that isn't well documented. It's a good way to get to understand a certain project.

Teach. Volunteer. Mentor. These help you to build empathy.

Toastmasters programs.

Create: digital art, cook, plant a garden, woodworking, music.

What is a homelab?

Any sort of project that you built by youself. A home network of computers. A small raspberrypi microcontroller set up.

Everything is moving to an "as-a-service" set up.
Music. Food. Movies. Cloud. etc.

Operating a homelab can provide meaningful services that you can use.

By building a homelab, you have so much opportunity to learn about things that you didn't know you didn't know.

"Adventure is out there". You can do whatever you want to do.

How do you balance family time and side projects? - My future thought that the speaker didn't include in the presentation.
