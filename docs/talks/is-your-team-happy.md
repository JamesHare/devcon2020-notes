What is it important to discuss happiness?

A recent survey was conducted that shows happiness is at an all time low in Americans for the past 50 years.

We are continually chasing happiness. However, happiness leads to succes, not the other way around.

Mayo Clinic Staff say that the brain simply works better when it is in a positive state.

Negativity releases cortisol (which leads to fight or flight mode)

Positivity releases copamine and serotonin (improve visual cortex and more neural connections).

How do we monitor happiness?

* Bio-feedback devices?
* Affect detection?
* Collection data from wearables?
* Look for relevant metrics we think correlate? Overtime?
* The best way is to just ask the team how they are feeling through an anonymous survey.

Happiness surveys

* 10 questions tops (5 if it's monthly)
* Consistent questions and the same metrics you are measuring it on
* Test out the survey on a coworker before sending it out
* Use non-biased language ("please complete the survey before end of the week" over "let me know how we are doing because I may lose my job")

Collect the data over time to see how your team are happy over time. Different times of the year. People leaving the team. Layoffs.

Do NOT try to find out who left negative feedback as you will break trust and buy-in to the survey.

How to be happy:

* Prime your brain for happiness.
    * Perception defines reality.
* The simplest way to get a happiness boost is to **smile**.
* List 3 positives per day. So much of our jobs as Software Engineers are focused around the negatives. Solving problems. Solving bugs. Being neck deep in the negatives.
* Look back over the previous day and sort through the positives. List 3. Just write it down with pen and paper to make sure you have a very low activation effort.
* Lean on your social network for support.
* Show appreciation and gratitude.
    * Say thank you!
* Take small boosts of happiness throughout the day
    * Cat videos
    * Memes
    * Listening to music
    * Anticipating small bosts of happiness increases cortisone throughout the day
        * Add funny pictures to slides during a talk
* Meditation
    * A way to reset the brain
* Exercise your mind and body

Priming your team for happiness:

* Schedule regular time with the team for bonding without doing work
    * Team outings
    * Virtual lunches/ coffee time/ happy hour
* Make sprint retrospectives and SWOTs habitual
    * Celebrate and aknowledge what went well
    * Call out things that didn't
* Embrace recognition opportunities
    * Company awards
    * Just sending an email saying good job helps
* Works and language matter
    * Your team follows the tone that you set for them.
    * Don't say "this meeting is going to suck" before going into a meeting. You will prime them for failure.
        * Instead recognize it as a challenge.
    * Don't call anything a post-mortem. Instant negativity.

Calls to action:

* Value your happiness
    * Defined your happiness
    * Dont' put it to the side
    * If you are positive and happy, you WILL be successful
    * Be happy and spread the ripple effet of happiness

Create a culture that PRIORITIZES happiness!
