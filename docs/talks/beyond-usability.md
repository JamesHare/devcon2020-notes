# Beyond Usability

Useability is a powerful tool. It insuures that we build do what it is meant to do.

Usability has limitations.

Research and Design phases:
* Exploration
* Creation
* Validation
* Refinements
* Wash, rinse, and repeat

Usability can help or harm. It's possible to create a highly usable product without it being useful.

We have to understand complex systems and understand the workflows of our clients.

Context is key. People don't always use tools in ways that we think they do.

New Design Perspectives:

How do we find the good stuff? Start with a problem.

When usability empowers a user, it also disempowers that same user. "Don't make me think" by Steve Krug. Don't make your users have to learn new skills to operate your software.

Look at the Crash of Air France in 2009. The autopilot was left on and within 5 mins crashed into the Atlantic. After post-crash analysis, it was found to be a problem of "de-skilling" due to more reliance on software over time. When they have to take manual intervation, they didn't know what to do due to lack of practise.

Read "Ironies of Automation" paper. 3 pages long.

Designers typically look at what users do with the product (flying by autopilot). They don't think about what users still have left to do.

Design the non-use scenarios.

Design for skill preservation.
* Intermittent automation (don't use autopilot or dev tools too much)
* Person-in-the-loop (human is handling the high level choices)
* Awkward mish-mash (maintaining a mix of both automation and using skills at random)
* Simulation (build a simulator for the humans to play along)

 ###Usability does not guarantee usefulness

Examlpe: Sign language translation gloves. It sounds great but deaf people say they could just use a keyboard like everyone else.

Designer ---> empathy ---> users

### Participatory Design

When developing a city, people got angry about certain buildings going up. The city scrapped the idea and coordinated a collection of the community to design it as they would like it. It worked!

It's hard for designers to learn "enough" about the users. It's easier for users to learn "enough" about design.

### Improving usability can amplify political conflicts

"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have choen the side of the oppressor" Desmond Tutu.

Nextdoor is an app for connecting with your neighbors. For years, it has been acused of providing users a way to racially profile their neighbors.

### Adversarial Design

Make people more productive with roadblocks. Use annoying design tricks to try to pull people out of their bad workflows.

### When we make something so easy that anyone can use it, human beings become interchangable.

Maslach Burnout Inventory:

* Depersonalization
* Emotional exhaustion
* Sense of powerlessness

" The software changes how people work together. They'd become more disconnected; less likely to see and help one another and often less able to." - Doctor from Brigham and Women's Hospital.

### Permaculture

A design paradigm modelled after natural ecosystems where everything is viewed as webs of relationships.

Ideas from Permaculture:

* Use edges and value the marginal.
* Produce no waste.
* Design from patterns to details.
* Apply self-regulations and accept feedback.
* Obtain a yield
* Observe and interact
* Creatively use and respond to change.

Usability is one tool, not the only tool.
