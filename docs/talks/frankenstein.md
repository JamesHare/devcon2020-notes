# Frankenstein: Building a Monster

Don't work seperately from a Solution Designer. Don't be like Doctor Frankenstein, who is unwilling to face his monster.

"Is git like a Cerner thing?" - How do you handle a question from people who don't know the topic? Educate. Extend a helping hand.

Don't be afraid to walk each other through problems, technical or not. We can learn from each other. Try to break the system. What can we throw at the system now so that we can correct it now?

Doctor Frankenstein worked on his own. He developed at night in the dark and built a monster that no one wanted. DON'T WORK ALONE!

Embrace Healthy Conflict - It's not you vs. me. It's you & me vs. the problem.

"When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary." - Bits and Pieces, The Economic Press. It's ok to play devils advocate as long as you do it respectfully.

Frankenstein was first hackathon. Mary Shelly was in Switzerland staying with group of writers challenged to write a story scarier than the others could write. My take is that you shouldn't force ideas to be born. Just let them be born.

Part take in Hackathons, DevCon talks, Tech talks, etc. as it gets your name around.

Development Ivory Tower. DON'T WORK ALONE! Doctor Frankenstein would have created something a lot better if he had involved the townsfolk more. The townsfolk wanted a steam engine, doctor frankenstein built a monster. He didn't document it, built it, and the townsfolk were left to deal with something they never wanted.

Here's how to listen to your clients:

* Ux Meetings - Include external and internal stakeholders in UX meetings.
* One-time Kickoff. Have a 1 time kickoff "collaboration meeting" with clients to tell them what you are going to do.
* Optimization labs. Several clients get to see the fleshed out idea more.
* Shadow and Survey. Shadow and survey 2-3 heavily invested clients on a workflow that you are trying to solve.
* Design Sprint. Consider a design sprint to work through the actual design of an app. 4 days. Involve the UX and IP teams. Behavioral Researchers. Take client pain points and group them into common themes.
    * Crazy 8's. Take 8 mins to come up with 8 ideas on a folded peice of paper.

What can you do to break down barriers?
Is your ego in check or are you difficult to work with?
Have you looked for opportunites (hackathons, deisgn sprints, etc.) to prove out your ideas?
Are you involving your clients early enough and prior to dev?
Are you too afraid of getting negative feedback? The way forward is iterative feedback.
